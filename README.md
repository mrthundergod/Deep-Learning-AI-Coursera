# Deep-Learning-AI-Coursera
Notes and Code for Deeplearning.ai Course on Coursera

## What is Deep Learning?
Deep Learning or Deep Structured Learning or hierarchical learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on learning data representations, as opposed to task-specific algorithms

The process of learning data representation is also called Feature Learning which allows a system to automatically discover the representations needed for feature detection or classification from raw data.
