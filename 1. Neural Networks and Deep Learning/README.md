## What is an Artificial Neural Network?
Artificial Neural Networks or ANNs or Connectionist systems are interconnected nodes similar to the vast netwrok of neurons in the human brain. It is a processing paradigm inspired off the biological network of the brain. The NN isn't an algorithim but, a framework for many different machine learning algorithms to work together and process complex data inputs.An ANN is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons. Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit a signal from one artificial neuron to another. An artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it.

Let's take an example of a predicting house prices using a NN.

Above shows the simplest NN with a single neuron, one input and one output. As per the example the input is the size of a house and the output is the price.
